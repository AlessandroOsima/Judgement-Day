PROTOTYPES
You can use this section of the repository to store work in progress art/code/sound/drawings you'd like to see in the game so that the rest of the team can then see them and share their opinions about them.
Create a folder for every new "thing" you create and also add a readme with a description of what it is you are adding and why you believe it's awesome.
